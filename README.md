# Scripting Demo

## Intro

This project is meant to highlight some of the basic and intermediate skills I picked up during my DevOps education in regards to bash scripting and Linux. The project itself is a collection of individual short scripts that collect and format various datapoints from the machine on which the program is run. The programs were developed on Ubuntu 18.04, running them on other OS might result in unexpected errors.

Run menu.sh for basic navigation or each script can be run manually as well.

## List of programs

- Check stats of OS (distribution, version, last program installed/uninstalled/modified)
- Check stats of computer (memory, CPU, disk usage)
- Check if services (sshd, bluetooth, NetworkManager) are available and their current status
- List the top 5 processes consuming most of the CPU right now
